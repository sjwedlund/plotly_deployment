# Plotly Deployment

This project is part of the Data Analytics Bootcamp at University of Oregon.

## Project Objective
The purpose of this assignment is to read in a JSON file of bacterial data and interpret that data using plotly and Javascript. I have created a horizontal bar chart, a bubble chart, and a gauge chart, with a customized dashboard in order to identify the top 10 bacterial species found in belly buttons. If Improbable Beef identifies a species of navel bacteria as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, they can be identified with these visualizations. 

### Technologies Used
